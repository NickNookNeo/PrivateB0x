The Mystery Smell

“I’ve got one!” Cloe shouted. Cliffford, the big rad dog, and his friends U-Bone, Cloe, Moc, Cassy, and Bub were playing their favorite game – Mystery Smell.

“It’s smoky and garlicky and meaty,” said Cloe, “and it’s coming from a backyard!” The other dogs trotted down the street, sniffing everywhere until they found the source of the smell.

“It’s a backyard barbecue!” called U-Bone from across the street. “I smell carne asada!”
“You got it!” Cloe answered.

“My turn!” said Cliffford as he caught a whiff of something on the breeze. “It’s strong, almost but not quite like mint, and it’s coming from up high.”

“Hmmm,” thought the others. They passed through a park at the end of the street, and the others found the smell right away. “Eucalyptus trees!” Moc declared triumphantly, looking up into the tall trees that grew around the perimeter of the park.

Cassy’s nose picked up the trail of a jogger, and the dogs gleefully bounded along, following it until it ended at a house a few blocks away.

“I smell something citrusy!” U-Bone barked, and his friends sniffed the air. They found a neighbor picking lemons off a tree in their front yard.

“GUYS!” shouted Bub. “I have one, and it’s amazing!”

“What is it like?” Cliffford wondered, and the others waited expectantly.

“Well, it’s...you know...sort of...something...with a hint of...I can’t explain it.” Poor Bub was just a puppy and didn’t know the names of all the tantalizing smells in the neighborhood.

The other dogs sniffed their noses in all directions, hoping to help Bub name the smell he had found. Suddenly, they heard a “yip!” and a scratching of claws and the dogs turned to see Bub bounding away down the street.

“Bub!” shouted Cliffford. Bub kept on running. The big rad dog sighed. “Bub is such a little puppy, but he always gets into BIG trouble. We’d better go after him.”

Cliffford, U-Bone, Cloe, Moc, and Cassy took off after Bub. They practically flew over the sidewalk! They reached the end of the block to see Bub’s tail disappear around the corner. They rounded the corner themselves and stopped short.

“What is that huge building?” U-Bone asked. The dogs stared together at the building, which was situated in the middle of a very large, very busy parking lot.

“It’s a shopping mall!” Cloe shouted. “Miss Dollar takes me there sometimes. People go there and look at things, and sometimes they take the things out in bags.”
“Bub just went inside, guys. We’d better go in after him,” Moc said. The dogs quickly but carefully crossed the street, navigated the cars circling for parking spots, and made their way to the double doors of the BIZWELL MALL.

The mall had two floors, so the dogs split up. U-Bone and Cloe dashed for the escalators and each took one side of the top floor. Moc and Cassy stayed downstairs and each took a side. Cliffford went down the middle, with his feet on the first floor and his nose up in the second!

All five dogs dodged strollers and shopping bags, kiosks and benches, as they continued in pursuit of Bub.

Bub, meanwhile, was having a fantastic time. He had no idea what this huge building was, but the smells were tantalizing! He found a place with all kinds of different food, from curries to noodles to pizza to tacos, labeled Food Court. He picked up the smell of freshly baked waffle cones, and chocolate chip ice cream as he ran by a kiosk, and paused only briefly to lick the remains of a child’s dropped cone.

Bub passed a storefront selling candy, and savored the whiffs of peppermint candy canes and caramels and chocolates coming from the entrance. He scampered by a store loaded with candles, body lotions and sprays, all with fruity and floral fragrances.

“Shoes!” squealed Bub, as he skittered past a store with hundreds of pairs of brand-new sneakers lining the walls. Bub was tempted to dive headfirst into the store selling leather handbags and wallets and belts and jackets, and chew on everything in sight, but he thought better of it. Besides, all the smells he smelled in this wondrous building were familiar. None of them were the new and enticing scent he was trying to find.

Passing a coffee-and-tea kiosk and inhaling the aroma of the freshly ground beans and steaming cups of tea, Bub found himself at the other end of Bizwell Mall. He had nowhere to go but straight into the anchor store at the end, dodging displays as he kept sniffing. The scent was getting stronger – he must be almost there!

Wearily, the other dogs approached the anchor store as well, just in time to see Bub running headlong into it. They summoned the last of their energy, marveling at Bub’s stamina, and ran through the store themselves.

“Well, I think we’ve lost him,” Cliffford huffed to his friends. “I don’t see him anywhere, and we’re here at the exit.”

“Wait!” Cassy shouted. “Isn’t that Bub outside?”

The dogs burst out the doors and into the cool air, and there was Bub, happily rolling around on the ground.

“I found it, guys!!” Bub called, as he flopped on his back once more and wriggled in the source of his scent: pine needles, fallen from hundreds of freshly cut Christmas trees, filling up a large portion of the parking lot outside the store.
The other dogs agreed that Christmas trees did smell very, very good. Bub had not caused any damage, only a merry chase, so they were all quite relieved. They all meandered through the tree lot, sniffing and looking.

Cliffford decided that he wanted to get a tree for his doghouse, and picked the biggest, tallest tree he could find. It was taller than he was! The proprietor of the Christmas tree lot wrapped it up for him with rope, making two straps that Cliffford could wear like a backpack. Bub proudly jumped up on Cliffford’s head as they headed for home, with the other dogs close behind.

Emma was waiting back at Cliffford’s doghouse, hoping to read him a story, and she gaped as the dogs entered the doghouse. She laughed when she saw what they had with them, and said, “I think we’re going to need more decorations than what we have in the garage!”

In the end, it took two trips back to the mall, a hundred strands of lights, and a thousand ornaments to decorate the huge tree. The dogs gave Bub the honor of plugging it in, and they all agreed it was the best Christmas tree ever.
